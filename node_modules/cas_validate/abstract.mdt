# A node.js module for CAS validation

This talk will present our node.js module for leveraging a CAS single
signon service.  The module is open source and available on GitHub,
and we would love to see wider adoption and use of the module.
Node.js is a new-ish server platform that is gaining in popularity
because it is based on JavaScript.

We needed to write our own node.js module to integrate with the
[Express] (http://expressjs.com/) web framework because at the time
none of the other available modules enabled single sign off. We
started with a simple service that verified whether a user was logged
in to the CAS server, and gradually expanded its functionality.


While the focus of the presentation will be on describing our CAS
client, a broader goal is to introduce node.js to an audience who may
be familiar with client-side JavaScript, but not with server-side.

# Program committee notes

We chose CAS because it is open source, enterprise-grade, and widely
supported.  Our initial uses were integrating it with Drupal, with
Redmine (our issue tracking system), and then with our small Sakai
installation.  It worked so well that our project sponsors at Caltrans
suggested that all of our services should be integrated with CAS.  For
my project, this meant that I had to write my own CAS client in
node.js.  When we moved away from Drupal, my  module allowed that
transition even though the new CMS didn't have a CAS module.

My secondary goal for this presentation is to evangelize for node.js.
We use it where we used to use perl; as a dedicated web environment;
as a thin web wrapper for databases; and as a proxy on our CMS system.
